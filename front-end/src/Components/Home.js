        A place to find or offer short-term pet care, neighbor to neighbor
      </h4>
      <p>We love our pets like family. But due to circumstances outside our control, sometimes we can't take care of our four-legged friends for short periods of time. Boarding and professional pet sitting can both be prohibitively expensive. Whether it's due to hospitalization, housing insecurity, or any other situation where you can't care for your animals, PawPair is here to help pet owners connect with people nearby who can tend to their pets.</p>
